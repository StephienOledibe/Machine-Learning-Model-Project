    <!-- Hello! Welcome to the IMAGE TEMPLATE YAAY \(^0 ^)/
  You're in the process of building something *amazing*
  
  Tips to get started:
  1) Change the text on line 29 to a new title for your website!
    (P.S. You can also change the tab title on line 6)

  2) Paste a link to your model in the "script.js" file (you can find it in the menu on the left)

  3) Press the Start! button in the Webview panel to see your model in action -(*o* )- . Note: It may take a few seconds to load.

  Press the refresh button in the Webview to close the camera.

  4) Add your own colors and styling in the "styles.css" file in the left menu!

      <p>
        Welcome to my AI-powered image classifier! Once you click the
        <strong>"Start"</strong> button, your camera will activate. Simply point
        your phone or laptop camera at a device — like a smartphone or a
        computer — and the model will try to recognize it. This is part of my
        very first AI project, and I'm excited to share it with you!

            Hi! I am Stephien Oledibe, Steph for short. I am a Computer Science
            major at Lincoln University of Pennsylvania with a growing passion
            for technology. I am super excited to be working on my very first AI
            project — a field I have been curious about for a long time. Big
            thanks to Kode with Klossy for making this possible! Moving forward,
            I hope to keep building my skills and see where this journey takes
            me.
