# Real-Time Device Classifier ‚Äî My First Machine Learning Project

Welcome! This is an **AI-powered real-time image classifier** I built to recognize everyday devices ‚Äî like **smartphones**, **laptops**, and **tablets** ‚Äî using your webcam, directly in your browser.

---

## Project Overview

This project uses a custom-trained **image classification model** to detect and identify different devices in real time.  
When you click **Start**, your webcam activates and the model predicts which device it sees ‚Äî instantly.

---

## How It Works

- The model was trained using **TensorFlow.js**.
- It runs **entirely in the browser** ‚Äî no server required.
- The web page uses the **Webcam API** to capture live video, then processes the video frames for predictions.
- Results are displayed live on the page.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML & CSS** ‚Äî page structure and styling  
- **JavaScript** ‚Äî to handle webcam control and run predictions  
- **TensorFlow.js** ‚Äî to load and run the trained model in the browser  
- **Webcam API** ‚Äî for real-time camera access

---

## Purpose

This project is part of my **first AI & Machine Learning experience**. I built it to:
- Learn the fundamentals of **training and deploying an image classifier**
- Combine **machine learning** with **web development**
- Explore how AI can power simple, interactive web tools

---

## How to Use

1. Click the **Start** button on the page.
2. Allow your browser to access your **camera**.
3. Point your camera at a device (phone, laptop, tablet).
4. Watch the live prediction appear!

## What I Learned

- How to train and test an image classification model
- How to deploy a model in the browser with **TensorFlow.js**
- How to connect **webcam input** to live predictions
- Building a user-friendly AI project for the web
